#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

  -Software Engineering is a systematic approach to designing, developing, maintaining and improving software systems to ensure they are reliable, efficient and 
  scalable. It is important because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of life like communication, commerce, 
  entertainment and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  i) Agile methodologies (2000s)-this emphasized collaboration, flexibility and iterative development.
  ii) Rise of OOP (1980s)- languages like C++, Java promoted modular, reusable code which improved software scalability and maintainability.
  iii) The Birth of software engineering(1968)- software engineering was introduced at the NATO conference marking the recognition of software development as a 
       formal discipline.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  i)Requirements gathering: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  ii)Design: creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and UI.
  iii)Implementation: writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  iv)Testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  v)Deployment: releasing the software to users.
  vi)Maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  -Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins and it is best for projects with well-defined 
   requirements and minimal expected changes like government projects while agile is an iterative approach, allowing for continuous development, testing and 
   changes 
   and it is suitable for projects that user requirements evolve over time e.g startups.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  i)Software Developer: designs, codes and implements the software solution based on project requirements.
  ii)Quality Assurance Engineer: tests the software to ensure it is bug free and meets quality standards.
  iii)Project Manager: manages the project timeline, resources and communication.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  i)IDEs: tools like VSCode, Intellij IDEA are software that provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code.
  ii)Version control systems: software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g git, subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  i)Changing requirements: requirements may change during the development cycle leading to project delays and this can be overcome by implementing agile practices 
  that allow flexibility in adapting to new requirements.
  ii)Technical debt:  Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. To 
  overcome this, time is needed to be allocated for refactoring and code reviews to ensure code quality.
  iii)Ensuring cross-functional communication.
  -Strategy: Use collaboration tools like Slack or Jira and have regular meetings to align team members across functions.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  i)Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions to verify they work correctly.
  ii)Integration Testing: Verifies that multiple components or systems work together as intended.
  iii)System Testing: Evaluates the entire software system to ensure it meets requirements.
  iv)Acceptance Testing: Confirms that the software meets the end-user’s needs and is ready for deployment.
  -Testing is crucial to ensure software reliability, security, and performance.
  
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  -Prompt engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. it is important because it helps in avoiding 
   vague responses by making your questions clear and specific so that the AI model understands your exact needs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  -Example of a Vague Prompt: “Explain programming.”
  -Improved Prompt: “Provide a brief overview of Python programming, including its common use cases and advantages.”
  -Explanation: The improved prompt is specific and concise, guiding the AI to focus on Python and outline its main applications and benefits, resulting in a more 
   informative response.
